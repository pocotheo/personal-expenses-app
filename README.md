# Personal Expenses App

The second app I built during my Flutter and Dart Course by Max Schwarzmuller.

## Description

The app lets you input your personal expenses: name of the thing you purcahsed, the amount you spent on it, the date when you made the purchase; and shows this list on its main page. Above the list there's graph showing on which day of the week you spent the most money.
